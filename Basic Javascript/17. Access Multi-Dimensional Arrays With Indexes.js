                                            Access Multi-Dimensional Arrays With Indexes
                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------
                                     
One way to think of a multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays. When you use brackets to access your array, the first set of brackets refers to the entries in the outer-most (the first level) array, and each additional pair of brackets refers to the next level of entries inside.

Example

var arr = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9],
  [[10,11,12], 13, 14]
];
arr[3];
arr[3][0];
arr[3][0][1];
arr[3] is [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14], arr[3][0] is [10, 11, 12], and arr[3][0][1] is 11.

Note: There shouldn't be any spaces between the array name and the square brackets, like array [0][0] and even this array [0] [0] is not allowed. Although JavaScript is able to process this correctly, this may confuse other programmers reading your code.

Using bracket notation select an element from myArray such that myData is equal to 8.

/* ----------------------------------------- Test Cases ------------------------------------------- */
//1. myData should be equal to 8.
//2. You should be using bracket notation to read the correct value from myArray.

/* ----------------------------------------- Solutions ------------------------------------------- */
var myArray = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [[10, 11, 12], 13, 14]];

var myData = myArray[2][1];


// Manipulate Array With PUSH()
var arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
arr1.push(4);

var arr2 = ["Stimpson", "J", "cat"];
arr2.push(["happy", "joy"]);

myArray.push(["dog", 3]);
