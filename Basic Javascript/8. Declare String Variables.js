                                                    Declare String Variables
                                                --------------------------------
Previously we have used the code

var myName = "your name";
"your name" is called a string literal. It is a string because it is a series of zero or more characters enclosed in single or double quotes.

Create two new string variables: myFirstName and myLastName and assign them the values of your first and last name, respectively.

/* -------------------- Test Cases ----------------------- */
// 1. myFirstName should be a string with at least one character in it.
// 2. myLastName should be a string with at least one character in it.

/* -------------------- Solutions ----------------------- */
var myFirstName = "tanmay";
var myLastName = "Modh";
