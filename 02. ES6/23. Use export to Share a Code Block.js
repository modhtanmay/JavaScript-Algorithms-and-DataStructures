/*
Use export to Share a Code Block
--------------------------------

Imagine a file called math_functions.js that contains several functions related to mathematical operations. One of them is stored in a variable, add, that takes in two numbers and returns their sum. You want to use this function in several different JavaScript files. In order to share it with these other files, you first need to export it.

export const add = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
}
The above is a common way to export a single function, but you can achieve the same thing like this:

const add = (x, y) => {
  return x + y;
}

export { add };
When you export a variable or function, you can import it in another file and use it without having to rewrite the code. You can export multiple things by repeating the first example for each thing you want to export, or by placing them all in the export statement of the second example, like this:

export { add, subtract };
There are two string-related functions in the editor. Export both of them using the method of your choice.


************************************************** IMPORT TO ACCESS SHARED CODE BLOCK **************************************** 


import allows you to choose which parts of a file or module to load. In the previous lesson, the examples exported add from the math_functions.js file. Here's how you can import it to use in another file:

import { add } from './math_functions.js';
Here, import will find add in math_functions.js, import just that function for you to use, and ignore the rest. The ./ tells the import to look for the math_functions.js file in the same folder as the current file. The relative file path (./) and file extension (.js) are required when using import in this way.

You can import more than one item from the file by adding them in the import statement like this:

import { add, subtract } from './math_functions.js';
Add the appropriate import statement that will allow the current file to use the uppercaseString and lowercaseString functions you exported in the previous lesson. These functions are in a file called string_functions.js, which is in the same directory as the current file.
