                                                Concatenating Strings with Plus Operator
                                             ----------------------------------------------
                                             
In JavaScript, when the + operator is used with a String value, it is called the concatenation operator. You can build a new string out of other strings by concatenating them together.

Example

'My name is Alan,' + ' I concatenate.'
Note: Watch out for spaces. Concatenation does not add spaces between concatenated strings, so you'll need to add them yourself.

Example:

var ourStr = "I come first. " + "I come second.";
The string I come first. I come second. would be displayed in the console.

Build myStr from the strings This is the start. and This is the end. using the + operator.

/* --------------------------- TestCases ---------------------------- */
//1. myStr should have a value of the string This is the start. This is the end.
//2. You should use the + operator to build myStr.
//3. myStr should be created using the var keyword.
//4. You should assign the result to the myStr variable.

var myStr; // Change this line

// changed

var myStr = "This is the start. " + "This is the end."; // Change this line
